    <h1>Chinese</h1>
    <p>
        I have tried chinese food from about 20 resturants around the USA but I have never been to
         China so I cannot say that I have tried authentic Chinese food and it may be different when in China.

    <h2>Spring Roll</h2>
    <p> 
        The spring roll is an amazing assortments of veggies and sometimes meat (depending on where you get it)
         and it either has a fried outside or a consu,able rice paper around the outside.
         I love this food for my appetizer and it is super healthy if you get the rice papaer outside.
         If you are fine with a couple more calories the fried outside is amazing but if you are going for a 
         healthy apetizer to start the meal the rice paper wrapped is amazing.
         It is also a great option for vegetarions and vegans because the rice wrapped spring roll meets both conditions.

    <h2>Fried Rice</h2>
    <p>
        Fried rice is a food that can be either an entree or an appetizer.
        Fried rice is rice,veggies,egg and meat fried on a stove and then drizzled with soy sauce and put in a bowl.
        Fried rice is amazing and is very unique in the way that it completeley changes the way the rice tastes.
        The egg and meats are so good in the rice.
        Can be vegetarion if you remove the rice.

    <h2>Orange Chicken </h2>
    <p>
        Orange Chicken is my favorite dish out of all Chinese dishes.
        Orange Chicked is chicken with a fried outside shell then soaked and sauted in a sweet and spicy sauce.
        It tastes amazing and goes great on top of or with rice/fried rice.
        I personally would recomend it to anyone who has not had it and I think it is great.
        not vegetarian or vegan.   v

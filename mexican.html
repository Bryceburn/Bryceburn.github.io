    <h1>Mexican Food</h1>
    <p>
        Mexico has its own culture and ideas and if you try food in mexico it will taste different than if you try it in America. 
        I have been to mexico and I have tried food in both Mexico and in America and I will be reviewing my opinion on both of them.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Empanadas</h2>
    <p>
        The empanada is an amazing appetizer than I would recomend anyone who is new to mexican food gets.
        It is a fried pastry that has a meat with sauce and depending on where you get it rice and beans on the inside.
        It is so delicous and the crunch with the juicy meat really creates a great mix.
        I would recomend getting the steak option but chicken is also really good.
        If you are looking for something more healthy this is not the best option due to the fact that the pastry 
        is fried but I think it is the best mexican appetizer
    </p>

    <h2>Horchata</h2>
    <p>
        If you are looking for a Mexican drink that is huge in both America and Mexico My recomendation is Horchata.
        Horchata does not have any alchohal in it so anyone can have it and it is something that you can make at your house.
        The most basic recipe for horchata is to mix milk cinnamon and sugar together and it makes a delicous drink.
        If you go to resturants they may have their own variations but this is themost basic recipe and it leaves a great taste in your mouth.
        If you do not like the tast of milk that is fine because it gets completely changed in horchata and ends up tasting a lot like cinnamon.

    <h2>Enchiladas</h2>
    <p>
        Enchiladas are a main dish that is a tortilla soaked in either red sauce or green sauce and has either cheese or meat on the inside.
        It is generally served with a side of rice and beans and is in my opinion the best mexican dish.
        I think that enchiladas are amazing and they have their own unique flavor. I like the meat options but the best enchilada is a cheese enchilada.
        The cheese is melted and is warm and melts into your mouth. 
        The sauce backs it up with a little bit of spice and then you can eat your rice and beans with it or with a side of chips wich is the best.
        It is a vegetarion option and I think it is amazing and the best mexican food.
